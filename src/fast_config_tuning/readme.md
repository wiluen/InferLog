## Fast Inference Config Tuning
To achieve a fast and tailored configuration optimization, we introduce Attention mechinism[47] in Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning to identify optimal initial parameters of the model for the target tuning tasks and then adopt Sequential Model-based Optimization (SMBO) to update the meta-model through fewshot learning with newly collected data to rapidly recommend best
configuration in a few iterations.
